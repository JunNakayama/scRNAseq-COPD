# scRNAseq-COPD
 
Welcome to the scRNAseq-COPD project! Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease that obstructs the airflow from the lungs, and tobacco smoking is the major cause of COPD. Here, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze COPD pathogenesis in COPD patients, non-COPD smokers and never-smokers and investigated the disease progression at single-cell resolution.
